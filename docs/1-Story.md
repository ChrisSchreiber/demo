# Rode demo

## Story

Rode is a software supply chain automated governance tool. It collects metadata from events that occur during the software delivery lifecycle (SDLC) and evaluates the metadata against policies to provide feedback of the state of SDLC and automate promotion of software releases. Read more about how Rode works [here](https://github.com/rode/rode/blob/main/README.md).

This demo installs and configures Rode and a sample software pipeline in a Kubernetes cluster to demonstrate metadata collection, policy evaluation and enforcement.
