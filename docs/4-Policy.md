Policies in Rode are implemented as [Rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/#rego) code which is evaluated by OPA to validate that the metadata collected for a give artifact meets the desired policy criteria.

## Creating Polices

*TODO: replace OPA call to populate policy with call to Rode API*
